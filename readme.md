A full-sized drag & drop event calendar (jQuery plugin).


About this fork
---------------

This fork (tpruvot/fullcalendar) is based on arshow Fullcalendar v2.2 branch.

It implements an additional year view (12 months) and can be used to display vacations periods.

The year table layout is customizable (2x6, 3x4, 4x3, 6x2), and the first month can be tuned to display school years.
